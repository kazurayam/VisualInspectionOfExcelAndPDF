# Visual Inspection of Excel and PDF

## Motivation

A few years ago, I worked for a media company in Tokyo. I was asked to develop a tool software, which is a sort of web scraping tool. The target page was [this](https://www.fsa.go.jp/policy/nisa2/about/tsumitate/target/index.html). It looks something like this:

![target](./docs/images/01_NISA_target_page.png)

You don’t have to understand this page in detail except the following points.

1.  The page has several `<a href="…​">` tags to Excel files and PDF files.

2.  The Excel & PDF files are updated by the publisher irregularly. Once a month, or once per 2 months. The frequency of updates are not determined.

3.  The publisher does not provide any push-style notification (like RSS) of page updates. The web page is updated and no more. Those who are interested in the information of this page have to keep watching the page.

4.  The company I worked for had a serious interest to the Excel files. Therefore some staffs are asked to visit this page everyday to watch if any changes are published.

5.  The staffs hated this job very much. They wanted some software tool to automate this bullshit job.
