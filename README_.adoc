= Patrol: visual inspection of Excel and PDF

== Motivation

A few years ago, I worked for a media company. I was asked to develop a tool software, which is a sort of web scraping tool. The target page is https://www.fsa.go.jp/policy/nisa2/about/tsumitate/target/index.html[this] (is still available to public at MAR 2022). The page looks something like this:

image:./docs/images/01_NISA_target_page.png[alt=target,width=640]

You don't have to understand this page in detail except the following points.

1. The page contains several `<a href="...">` tags to the URLs of Excel files and PDF files.
2. The content of Excel & PDF files are updated by the publisher irregularly. The frequency of updates are not determined. You can track the record: once a month, or once per 2 months.
3. The URL string of Excel/PDF files are fixed. The file names are fixed. You can not tell if the file has been updated by the file name.
4. The publisher does not provide any push-style notification (like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS[RSS]) for this page. Those who are interested in the information of this page are asked to keep watching the page, read it and find updates somehow.
5. The company I worked for had a serious interest in the Excel files. Some staffs were asked to visit this page everyday, and if any updates found, they are asked to trigger a series of actions to digest the Excel files. But usually they found the files unchanged.
6. The staffs hated this job. They wanted some system to automate this bullshit job.

Since then I have worked long to solve this problem. Finally I have got a solution. Let me describe it.

== Problem to solve

The Excel files in the page are irregularly updated, and the publisher does not provided any notification. Therefore my solution has to

1. visit the web page regularly and automatically, for example once a day
2. download the current version .xlsx files, compare the content with some previous version to find if any updates there are.
3. If any updates found, take some action. For example, transfer the .xlsx files into some organizational file server and send some notification to those who are concerned: send messages to MQ and E-mail etc.

The 1st problem (running a process regularly and automatically) is easy to implement using Linux https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron], Windows https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/about-the-task-scheduler[Task Scheduler], and some Continuous Integration servers like https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/[Team City]. Katalon offers https://www.katalon.com/testops/[Test Ops] of course.

The 3rd problem (taking some actions when your script find it necessary) can be solved by straight-forward custom programming.

The 2nd problem is challenging. **How can my software detect that the current version of an Excel file is updated? How can my software present visually the difference between the current and previous Excel files?**

How to compare a 2 Excel files? --- this is a technical challenge. My https://forum.katalon.com/t/visual-inspection-in-katalon-studio-reborn/57440[Visual Inspection in Katalon Studio] showed that my product is capable of comparing pairs of PNG images and pairs of text files regardles its format --- HTML, XML, JSON, CSV, CSS, JS. However, `.xlsx` and `.pdf` are binary files. My text differ module can not deal with those binary files.

== Solution

I would call my product **Patrol** for short. A Patrol will visit web site, scrape it, find changes in it, and take some actions.

I have developed and published a set of Java/Groovy library to build a Patrol for me and for you.

- https://github.com/kazurayam/materialstore/[materialstore]
- https://github.com/kazurayam/materialstore-mapper/[materialstore-mapper]

And https://github.com/kazurayam/VisualInspectionOfExcelAndPDF[This project] shows a sample built on top of these 2 libraries.




== Description

=== Target Application Under Test

I won't use https://www.fsa.go.jp/policy/nisa2/about/tsumitate/target/index.html[this page] as the testbed for demonstration, because 

1. this page is not updated frequent enough. It is updated only once per a month at most. I want a URL as testbed which is updated more frequently; I want once per 1 or 2 days.

2. this page is owned by a governmental organization. I do not like bothering them.

Instead I would use the following URL as the testbed for my demonstration:

- https://press.aboutamazon.com/rss/news-releases.xml[Amazon.com, Inc. - Press Room News Releases]

This URL provides a RSS feed in XML format, is updated frequently enough. I believe that the publisher (Amazon.com) would not stop me accessing it using my automated software.

My software would do a series of file format conversion: RSS XML -> Excel -> CSV.

== Demonstration

A example RSS document

```

This RSS document is internally converted into an Excel xlsx file, like this

And then the Excel xlsx file is coverted into a CSV text file, like this

The CSV text file is ready to diff. The materialstore library can easily compare a pair of "previous CSV" and "current CSV". The library can generate a report for human readers.
